# GP4MemLib

A C++ library of utility classes/functions for Grand Prix 4 modding 

## Description

A C++ library of classes and functions designed to help develop custom code for Grand Prix 4 modding and that will most likely be a constant WIP.

It can be included in your project by coping `GP4MemLib.h` and `GP4MemLib.cpp` directly into it, or by using the pre-compiled static or dynamic libraries.

## Documentation

The library is Doxygen-ready. Docs might be added to this section in the future
